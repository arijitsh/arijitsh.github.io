Arijit is a third-year Ph.D. student at the Chennai Mathematical Institute. His research interests lie in the field of formal methods, and he is particularly interested in designing scalable solutions for problems that lie beyond the complexity class of NP. His current focus is on designing model counters for different SMT theories, and he is advised by Dr. Kuldeep S. Meel of NUS, Singapore.
Prior to beginning his PhD studies, Arijit completed his M.Sc. at the Chennai Mathematical Institute and his B.Tech. at Jadavpur University. He has also achieved success in the field of SAT solvers, having won prizes in the SAT Competition 2020 and the EDA Challenge 2021.
