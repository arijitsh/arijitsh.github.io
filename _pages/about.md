Hi! I'm a joint PhD student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](http://www.cmi.ac.in) and [IAI, TCG CREST](https://www.tcgcrest.org/institutes/iai/), advised by [Kuldeep S. Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

My work explores the quantitative dimensions of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). I'm interested about extending SMT solvers to answer quantitative queries and developing techniques for sampling from SMT solution spaces. We have developed volume computing tool for SMT LRA formulas [[KR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09934),[ttc](https://github.com/meelgroup/ttc)], counting tools for hybrid SMT formulas [[DAC'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18612), [pact](https://github.com/meelgroup/pact)], bit-vectors formulas [[SMT'24](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3725/short2.pdf), [csb](https://github.com/meelgroup/csb)]
and Skolem functions [[AAAI'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12026), [SkolemFC](https://github.com/meelgroup/skolemfc)]. We have uniform sampler for bit-vector formulas [[SMT'24](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3725/short2.pdf), [csb](https://github.com/meelgroup/csb)] as well.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about seeing my research make real-world impact. My tools have promising applications in verifying AI systems (examining robustness and fairness properties), software verification, and analysis of cyber-physical systems. If you believe these tools or my research might benefit your work, please get in touch!

My curiosity extends to understanding the inner workings of automated reasoning systems. I've used causality to gain insights into SAT solvers [[SAT'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06294)], investigated the behavior of model counters on practical instances [[KR'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)], and designed innovative phase selection heuristics for SAT solvers [[SAT'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01499)].
