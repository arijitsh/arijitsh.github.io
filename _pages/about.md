Hi! I'm a joint PhD student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](http://www.cmi.ac.in) and [IAI, TCG CREST](https://www.tcgcrest.org/institutes/iai/), advised by [Kuldeep S. Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/). Currently, I am a visiting graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).

My research focus is on various aspectes of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in particular quantitative aspects of SMT.
  - Designed a counter for hybrid SMT formulas [[DAC'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)].
  - Designed a counter and sampler for bit-vectors formulas [[SMT'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)].
  - Designed a counter for functions [[AAAI'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)].

**Broader interests:** understanding how automated reasoning systems work.
  - In [[SAT'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06294)] we used causality to better understand SAT solvers.
  - In [[KR'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)] we explored why and how model counters behave on practical instances.
  - In [[SAT'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01499)] we desinged a phase selection heuristic for SAT solvers.
