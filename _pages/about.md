Hi! I'm a joint PhD student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](http://www.cmi.ac.in) and [IAI, TCG CREST](https://www.tcgcrest.org/institutes/iai/). Currently, I am a visiting graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). My PhD advisor is [Kuldeep S. Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/).

My research interest lies in building better systems for "Beyond SMT" problemsâ€”I focus on designing model counting tools for different SMT constraint theories and applying these tools to solve real-world problems.

Earlier, in 2019-'20, I was an intern at [Meel Research Group](https://meelgroup.github.io/), National University of Singapore. Before that, I studied Theoretical Computer Science and worked on Software Verification at Chennai Mathematical Institute, India.
