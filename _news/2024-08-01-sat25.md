[SAT '25](https://satisfiability.org/SAT25/) in Glasgow was fun! Second year of co-organizing the [Model Counting Competition](https://mccompetition.org/2025/mc_description). I also presented at the [SMT workshop](https://smt-workshop.cs.uiowa.edu/2025/index.shtml) and [model counting workshop](https://mccompetition.org/2025/mcw_description).
